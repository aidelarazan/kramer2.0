But I digress. \n\nThe mayor is taking a long time to get there, so Charles sets up his nikon camera (as mentioned before) and makes sure he has a good shot of the stage. However, the mayor arrives in a car behind him! This semi-foiled his plan of getting an unrehearsed facial expression from the mayor. However, he still gets a good shot when he purposefully asks him to smile, knowing it would produce a perfect scowl from the mayor.

Charles' goal with his photo was to finally earn the promotion that he deserved and gain the recognition that he desperately wanted. He went back to work and proceeded to email the photos to his boss. When the time came for Charles to see his photo in the paper he realized that his boss used another photo and when he confronted his boss about it he realized that he forgot to press send; his boss was a bit annoyed that he didn't send his photos over and Charles was angry with himself for ruining his chances at that promotion.""}",460483.6,NA,232

441,18,Charles,mainplot,mainplot,mainplot,"{""Q0"":""Charles Bort was a reporter trying to get a promotion to become chief editor. He was going to achieve his impressive moment to his boss by capturing the face of the \""crooked\"" mayor. When the time came though for the headline newspaper story to be printed, his captured picture was not the one on the cover. Angry, he stormed into the office to find out why this was not his winning-shot picture blasted everywhere with his name. The secretary repeatedly made him sit down in the lobby until the boss was out of his meeting. Finally once called back, the boss responded that he never submitted a photo to him. Bort cries out that he did, but does see that he never clicked send on the picture/email. Upset, he goes home. Charles Bort also seems like a very popular man--several friends call him for help or advice with their various endeavors. He always honestly responds and/or helps them out. At one point he does meet up with his mom in the park, who gives him comfort in dealing with the stress of his job and promotion. She tells him to be happy and enjoy himself more.Eventually (I think, can't quite remember) he does end up getting the promotion.""}",509719,NA,208
