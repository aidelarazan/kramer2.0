Before the mayor arrived Charles got a call from Melvin Doyle, where Melvin asked Charles to come see him perform in a month and Charles agreed to see him.

307,19,Charles,mainplot,mainplot,mainplot,"{""Q0"":""The entire story essentially resolves around Charles Bort, who is a photographer for the newspaper. He wants to get a promotion, so when the strongly disliked mayor holds a press conference, he is eager to go in order to potentially capture the mayor in a rather distasteful photograph, leading him to potentially getting his promotion. On the day of the press conference, he is wearing a yellow scarf. On the way there, he has friends calling him left and right, with Beatrice asking about a bike loan to Sandra talking about her sculpture art show to Melvin talking about searching for his keys in the dumpster. Eventually, Charles makes it to the press conference on his boss's bike and parks it at the meter. The mayor runs late, and when he eventually arrives at the podium (apparently late due to picking his daughter up from school), Charles catches him off-guard by saying, \""Smile, Mayor!\"" when another reporter previously asked him an off-putting question. The mayor glares, and Charles captures the shot. When Charles gets back to the office, he is ecstatic and rushes to upload the image, thinking this will be his big break. The next day, Charles meets with his mother at the park, and she brings him a tuna sandwich and some fruit. While Charles is excited about his potential promotion, his mother asks if he truly is happy with his job - Charles says he'll be happy after his promotion. When Charles asks his mother what she thought about the picture in the front-page article, his mother says she never saw a picture. To his horror, the picture Charles captured is indeed not there, but there is a photo of a smiling mayor. Charles rushes back to the office and demands to talk to his boss, and the secretary says he cannot speak about the afternoon paper because it's too late. When he meets with his boss, his boss says that they had to find another picture because Charles did not do his job. When Charles is about to exclaim that he captured the perfect picture, he realized that in his excitement, he forgot to send the email, and trudges out of his boss's office dejectedly and with no promotion.""}",453084.5,373
