A crowd had formed on the steps around the mayor’s podium, but Charles could not see the mayor.
He needed a better vantage point, so he maneuvered all the way to the front of the crowd.
Since the mayor was late, the other local reporters and photographers stood around chatting.
A woman with a small camera and notepad stood next to Charles, scribbling away.
Charles got her attention, and he asked, “Any idea why Mayor Frank is running late?”
She chuckled, “Apparently he dropped his daughter off at school, though he never does that.”
“I guess he wants us to go easy,” Charles laughed heartily, “But too bad he’s a crook!”",5,"While there, he met a journalist with red hair named Sandra. They were both waiting for the mayor to show up but he was late due to picking his daughter up.",4,,eb

“My first mural show starts tonight,” she said, “And a lot of sponsors are coming.”
“I get headaches from dealing with just a few people, let alone a hundred philanthropists!”
“Aren’t they supposed to purchase your art,” Charles began, but Sandra sighed.
“The short critic with the red sportscoat hates murals, and they always listen to her.”
“Don’t worry about her,” said Charles, “Do you want me to come and keep you company?”
“Maybe,” replied Sandra, “Because see, when she actually likes artists, she starts following them around!”
“So, I might be less anxious if you keep her from talking to me,” she continued before hanging up.",6,,,,eb

The crowd grew silent as the rumble of a police vehicle approached, then cut its engine.
It escorted an automobile from which Mayor Frank emerged with two security guards.
As soon as the Mayor reached the podium one journalist yelled, “Why did you graffiti the courthouse?”
The Mayor replied, but seeing his opportunity, Charles exclaimed “Smile, Mr. Mayor!”

“Actually, I haven’t,” said Charles, “And did you happen to lose that around the office?”
“It’s a bit embarrassing, but I forgot that my mortgage payment was past due,” he replied.
“You see, the payment was late, but the bank gave me an extension only if I use my credit card.”
“They’re letting me make the next payment by the end of the day,” Johnny continued, “Or else I’ll lose everything.”

One by one, Charles closely observed each photograph he had taken, looking for the one that would be his crowning achievement.
“Aha, this is it!” Charles exclaimed to himself as others in the room looked to his direction.
Embarrassed, Charles leaned into his computer screen and began frantically drafting an email with the attached photograph.

A red double-decker bus approached, and its doors swung open before he could reply.
Charles boarded the bus and greeted the bus driver, “Hey, how’s it going?”
The bus driver refused to turn his head towards Charles and impassively muttered “Mmm.”
Charles dismissed the bus driver’s aloof response and continued down the aisle, scanning the rows for an open seat.

“A dozen philanthropists are hocking me to paint their mansions,” said Sandra.
“Are you telling me that you had way too much of a good time at the show?” said Charles.
“You shouldn’t be worried, you could make a fortune off them,” Charles continued.
Sandra slowly stood up the chair and muttered, “There’s just too many of them.”
As she headed towards the exit, in walked a short woman with a red sportscoat.
Sandra avoided making eye contact with her and walked out, before ending the call.",11,,,,eb

Ethel handed Charles half of her tuna salad sandwich as Charles apologized, “Sorry I missed last week, mom.”
“I’ve been trying to build my portfolio,” Charles continued as she took a bite of her own.
“Don’t worry about it,” Ethel replied calmly, “You know I’m very proud of you.”
“But Charles,” she continued, “Can you at least tell me you’re enjoying yourself these days?”

“Not exactly,” he responded, “My boyfriend thought that Hawaii would be a relaxing place to visit.”
“He wanted to do something nice for me,” Johnny continued.
“Oh!” Johnny added in a subsequent text, “You want some leftover potatoes?”
Charles replied, “Of course, you know how much I always look forward to your cooking, and I’ll ask around about airline tickets.”

“It could have been a lot worse than this.” Beatrice chimed.

“Absolutely!” Beatrice exclaimed, “This is the least pain I’ve ever felt in my life!”
“My bicycle skidded out on a damp road, and I broke my fall with this arm.”
“That’s awful,” Charles replied, “Wasn’t it painful to keep using that arm?”
“Oh sure,” Beatrice said, “But I got back up, biked all the way back, and finished!”

He traversed several aisles of grey-walled cubicles to the managing editor’s closed door.
“He’s in a meeting,” explained the secretary at the long desk adjacent to the door.
“But it’s urgent,” said Charles, “It’s about today’s paper, he needs to hear it now.”
“It’s a bit late for that,” replied the secretary, who held out a fresh print of the evening paper.
Charles took hold of it and scanned the photo of a smiling mayor on the front cover.
“This is wrong!” he shouted, “I need to speak to him now, it’s the wrong photo!”
“Look Charles, just take a seat over there, and I’ll let you know when he’s ready.”",16,He ran past the Secretary and went straight into the Head Editor's office who was sitting at a mahogany desk. ,11,,eb

“Only yours truly taking the stage for a one-night performance,” he replied jubilantly.
“That’s fantastic,” said Charles, “I never doubted for a moment they’d let you perform!”
Melvin replied, “I’ll keep you posted on the date and tickets, so until then, wish me luck!”

“There’s a big problem,” Charles said gravely, “You got the wrong photograph on the cover!”
“Oh, you mean the photograph we had to buy since you didn’t do your job,” he replied.
“No way,” said Charles, “I sent you the perfect picture of the mayor yesterday morning!”
Charles suddenly realized he had never pressed “Send” on the email, and his boss was right.
“Never mind,” Charles relented, and left to sulk at his desk, with no promotion.",18,The Head Editor said that they had to pay someone else for a picture.

“My girlfriend and I are having trouble agreeing on whether to adopt a lab or a corgi.”
“Is this really that important?” Charles replied, “I don’t know anything about dogs.”
“It’s been rocky the past week,” she replied, “And my girlfriend thought a dog would make things easier.”
“But if she insists on adopting a Labrador with a Pink collar, I’m moving out!”

“It’s Shakespeare’s Hamlet, why else would I go around wearing this Elizabethan collar?”
“They’re short on actors, so if they like me, I could end up playing Hamlet or Ophelia.”
“I had to prepare two monologues, including Hamlet’s, ‘to be or not to be’ speech.”

It escorted an automobile from which Mayor Frank emerged with two security guards.
